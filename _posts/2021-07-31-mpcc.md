  <h1 class="major">Contouring Model Predictive Control for RWD Race-cars</h1>
    <!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
    <p>At DJS Racing, the Formula Student team of Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, we are building one of the first driverless formula student race-car. In this presentation, we are presenting to you the improved control architecture of our autonomous system for the year 2021.</p>
    <p>It is an extension of Contouring Model Predictive Control for RWD cars with a
    differential, using the HPIPM NLP solver. Globalrace-trajectory optimization
    for shortest time was done using Time-Optimal Trajectory Planning (Christ et
    al., 2019).</p>
