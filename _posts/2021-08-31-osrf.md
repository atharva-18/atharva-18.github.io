In this post I will be presenting my contributions to Open Robotics before joining them as a student developer. I contributed mainly to the Ignition Gazebo and Ignition RViz projects for a few months to get familiar with a large codebase.

## Ignition Gazebo

### About dialog

Adds an about dialog box to display version number, license, and documentation links.

Pull request - [https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/609](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/609)

### Modifying light intensity

Adds the ability to change the intensity of light entities in the simulation at runtime.

Pull request - [https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/670](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/670)

### Joint Position Controller topic validity

Sanity checks for user provided topic values in joint controllers.

Pull requests - [https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/632](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/632) and [https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/639](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/639)

## Ignition RViz

### TF transform status

Adds the ability to show TF transform status in RViz.

Pull request - [https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-rviz/pull/69](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-rviz/pull/69)

|TF Warn | TF Error | TF Valid |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |

### Bug fix in RViz FrameManager

Fixes a bug where RViz won't show entites in the absence of tf data.

Pull request - [https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-rviz/pull/67](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-rviz/pull/67)
