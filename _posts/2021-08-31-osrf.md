In this post I will be presenting my contributions to Open Robotics before joining them as a student developer. I contributed mainly to the Ignition Gazebo and Ignition RViz projects for a few months to get familiar with a large codebase.

## Ignition Gazebo

### About dialog

### Modifying light intensity

### Joint Position Controller topic validity

## Ignition RViz

### TF transform status

### Bug fix in RViz FrameManager
