At Auxilio Robotics, my MRSD capstone project team, I am working on a low-risk elderly assistance robot called Alfred. Alfred is a mobile robot that can navigate in indoor environments, and can perform tasks such as fetching objects, schedule reminders, engage with people, and more. I am working on the ROS infrastructure of the robot, and developing the human-robot interaction stack.

We recently made a visit to Vitalia Smart Senior Living at North Olmstead near Cleaveland, Ohio, to test our robot with the elderly. We received a lot of positive feedback, and are now working on improving the robot based on the feedback we received. Our visit was featured in a news article by Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science. You can read the article: [CMU SCS News - CMU Team Explores Future of Caregiving With Assistive Robot](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/2023/care-home-robot).

We are a team of 5, advised by Prof. Zackory Erickson (CMU Robotics Insitute) and Prof. Yonatan Bisk (CMU Language Technologies Institute). Our team members are:

1. Abhinav Gupta
2. Atharva Pusalkar
3. Praveen Venkatesh
4. Shaolin Kataria
5. Shivam Tripathy
