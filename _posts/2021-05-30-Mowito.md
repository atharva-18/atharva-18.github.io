Mowito is an Indian startup that provides autonomous navigation software solutions for use in warehouses and more. They have also recently expanded into providing physical robots with applications such as grocery delivery.

My work ranged from autunomous navigation, synthetic lidar data generation, remote troublshooting software to motion primitives generation.
