Mowito is an Indian startup that provides autonomous navigation software solutions for use in warehouses and more. They have also recently expanded into providing physical robots with applications such as grocery delivery.

My work ranged from autunomous navigation, synthetic lidar data generation, remote troublshooting software to motion primitives generation.

For the above demo, we used an RP LiDAR, with a resolution of 0.1 degrees at 10 Hz. The lidar map was converted to an image array to detect human foot clusters. After data association with existing foot position priors, the extended kalman filter was updated from the measurements.
