For two years of my undergrad, I was a member of the IEEE student chapter of my institute, DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering.

IEEE Brainwaves is the official IEEE student branch of Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering. The student chapter is responsible for coordinating & conducting various workshops and other activities at the institute, which include expert lectures, seminars, workshops, and industry visits, and mentoring sessions by alumni. These all are the initiatives by the department to ensure a holistic learning experience in the 4 years of engineering at DJSCE.

I joined the team as a technical team member back in 2019 - my sophomore year. I was then promoted as the Chairperson for the following academic year. I look back at the past two years spent at the club fondly. The work and topics ranged from photo editing, electronics, programming, to even the equity markets.

Here are a few glimpses of our events during the last year.

##	Drone Federation of India Seminar:
