Open Source Robotics Foundation) as a student developer. The project was in turn funded by Google through their Summer of Code 2021 program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in late 2020, I was looking at new open-source projects that I could contribute to, and by good fortune I stumbled upon the Ignition Robotics project. I was already a wee bit familiar with some of the software published by them and by Open Robotics at large - one of them being the Gazebo robotics simulator. I actively started contributing to their project by making small pull requests at first, such as adding an &lt;i&gt;about dialog&lt;/i&gt;, light intensity modification, and more. Three months later, I applied to the Summer of Code 2021 program at Open Robotics, and one fine day, after a video meeting and evaluation, I got the acceptance mail!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/gsoc_acceptance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Acceptance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch and hear me talk about the debugging features added to Ignition Gazebo in the Fortress release demo meeting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-project&quot;&gt;The Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/gsoc_open_robotics.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;GSoC&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, developing simulations worlds was a trial and error process, and users often had to provide computed values for robot inertia, joints, and mass properties, and hope that they will work in the simulation directly. If the physical behavior of the robot differed from what the user expected, there was no way to visualize what went wrong in the simulation world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the growing user base of the newer simulator, with it finding its applications in the industry and competitions such as the DARPA SubT challenge, it was becoming imperative to add capabilities to visualize values coming from the physics engine of Gazebo. Hence, this project was undertaken to add new features to visualize the robot inertia, mass, joints, and more at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-breakdown&quot;&gt;Project Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project involves working on two Ignition libraries - Gazebo and Rendering. The visual classes are first added to the Rendering library which is then consumed by the downstream Gazebo project. A total of 9 pull requests were made during this project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A%22atharva-18%22+created%3A%3E2021-05-01+closed%3A%3C2021-10-01++is%3Aclosed+&quot;&gt;Ignition Gazebo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-rendering/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A%22atharva-18%22+created%3A%3E2021-05-01+closed%3A%3C2021-10-01++is%3Aclosed+&quot;&gt;Ignition Rendering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since new visuals are first added to the Ignition Rendering library, this project also extends Ignition Rendering to have a visualization component along with sensors and cameras (Please refer to this video &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/JugZs9rzpKM?t=1227&quot;&gt;Ignition vs Gazebo Classic + Ignition Rendering: Community Meeting&lt;/a&gt; at 20:27 to get an idea about the architecture).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These visualizations primarily target the Ogre 1.9 and Ogre 2.2 render engines as guided by the Ignition Gazebo architecture. That being said, the joint visualization should work for the NVIDIA OptiX raytracing engine as well. Currently, Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 along with Windows 10 and above are supported. Support for macOS is not under development due to additional requirements for the Metal API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visualize-as-wireframe&quot;&gt;Visualize as Wireframe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users often need to debug their 3D meshes, hence we added a wireframe rendering mode to visuals, similar to Gazebo Classic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visualize-joints&quot;&gt;Visualize Joints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now visualize the joints of a robot while simulating or building it. Joints such as revolute, prismatic, universal, ball, and more are supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This visualization will be extended in the future to planned features such as the model and joint editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignition Gazebo:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/joints.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Joints&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the above-mentioned, I have also added features such as the &lt;i&gt;about dialog&lt;/i&gt; and light intensity fields during the pre-GSOC period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that this project will provide a better user experience to existing users and bring more people under the Ignition project by reducing the feature gap between the two simulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new visualizations will be released to the public with Ignition Fortress in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can test the new features by installing Ignition Fortress from Nightly builds and using the demo world provided in this repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After downloading, you can run the simulation by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ign gazebo -v 4 visualization_demo.sdf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignition Gazebo demo using a SubT vehicle:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/testing.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Testing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignition Rendering demo:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/rendering-demo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rendering Demo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small demo involving the visualization component of Ignition Rendering is now included with the source code starting with the Fortress release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to the Gazebo Classic simulator, the new Ignition libraries offer a decoupled architecture. Each component of Gazebo (For example, rendering, transport and physics) is now a separate library. The advantage is that developers can use the above-mentioned visuals for their own separate projects without having the overhead of unwanted Gazebo code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acknowledgments&quot;&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank my mentor, Alejandro Hernández Cordero, for supporting and guiding me during the entire program and before it. Thanks to the whole Open Robotics team for providing me with this opportunity, reviewing my work, and assisting me with the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/meet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Meet with Open Robotics development team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-programming part was just as much of an experience, if not more. The weekly team meetings were a great way of looking into project management and workflows. It was definitely worth staying up late at 1 AM in the night, working with people based in different timezones. Now, I am looking forward to giving my project presentation at the Ignition Fortress Demos Community Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work has helped me improve my programming skills, and I learned a great deal about 3D rendering and physics simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-me&quot;&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a final-year undergraduate engineering student at DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering, University of Mumbai pursuing Electronics Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I primarily work with autonomous robotics and self-driving software. I have been a part of the Formula Student team of my institute where we are building a self-developed autonomous race car. Through the team, I gained hands-on experience in robot navigation and perception and motivated me to further explore ROS and Gazebo. I have also worked at a startup to develop and deploy autonomous navigation software for use in warehouse environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time at Open Robotics, I had the opportunity to directly work on features that were being used by people in the robotics industry and academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I will be writing about the data acquisition system that I built with my teammates for the year 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our newest car &lt;i&gt;EO3&lt;/i&gt; employs a completely new sensor data acquisition system. A more powerful microcontroller, the Teensy 4.1 is used with the automotive-grade CAN protocol.
 Previously, we used analog signals to receive data rom the sensors that were prone to stray signals and noise. Also, since the testing track is a little far from the campus, we also added the capability to transmit live data to a cloud server using the ESP8266 board. The HC12 module was used to transmit data over a large distance considering the area of the Hockenheimring Baden-Württemberg racing circuit in Germany and the Kari Motor Speedway in India. The conversion of analog values from the sensors to 8-bit digital values is done on the &lt;i&gt;CAN node&lt;/i&gt; PCBs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overview of our data acquisition system:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A seperate interface circuitry is designed for a sensor whenever required, such as the pressure and wheel speed sensors. Together, we have integrated all the connections and designed the harness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schematic of the data logger PCB:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/djsr_data_logger_pcb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the electronics design report (read from page 32):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HlSNjRsue460ksPtxLEC5RipbiUN6Xma/preview&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that all of our subsystems work efficiently, we have developed our first-ever data visualization app. The app also supports Tableau integration for advanced data analysis and over-the-air (OTA) updates. We call the app “Nautilus”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our software stack is open-sourced on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/djsracing/Nautilus&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. The application offers features such as a dashboard, data plotting, post processing of data, live recording, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cloud-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Cloud infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/image10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overview of our cloud infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cloud framework is based on AWS EC2 compute platform and the flask micro web framework. socketIO is used to establish chat-rooms to relay sensor data in real-time. The data is also sent to Tableau client nodes through the Google Sheets API. Received data is logged to AWS S3 and PostgreSQL based database for backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;desktop-application&quot;&gt;Desktop Application&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dashboard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard features a grid view of all sensors present on the car. Users can create and save sessions from the top panel. The track mapping from GPS data is created on this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/image8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To debug any issues in each subsystem, the app provides an offline visualization and debugging page called “Analysis”. Users can select sensors and plot their graphs, lap-wise. Users are also presented with an option to load recorded data from a JSON file. Plots can be exported in CSV, SVG, and PNG file formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/image7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connection Page &amp;amp; Track Mapping&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/image9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can rename sensors and change their mapping from raw voltage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, team members need to change the mapping applied to the raw sensor voltages. Hence, we came up with a JavaScript arithmetic-based solution. Users can simply type in a JavaScript math expression and its unit for post-processing. This mapping configuration can be saved in a JSON file format to load variables instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plot Mode
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was our first season where we developed our in-house data visualization software stack. This app will be used as a foundation for future support of Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental support for ROS (Robot Operating System) data visualization is also under active development:

In conjuction, I also developed the data acquisition system for our vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a small video from 2019 about our work prior to building electric cars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we’ve been working remotely most of the times for the past one and half years, we’re on our way to finish building our next car by February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the team as an electronics member, and then I also started working on the driverless sub-system. Here’s our electronics design report, you can read about my work from the “Data Aquisition” section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HlSNjRsue460ksPtxLEC5RipbiUN6Xma/preview&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to develop my own PCB in college and through the team I was able to do so. The data acquisition PCB was designed by us using the Teensy 4.1 because it offered the computation power and power efficiency that was required by our low-voltage system. The MCP2551 CAN module was used for interacing the sensors with the main board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to SBG Systems for sponsoring us the Ellipse-N IMU, JLCPCB for manufacturing the PCBs, Analog Devices, Kvaser, and TE Connectivity for the components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;djs-racing-driverless&quot;&gt;DJS Racing Driverless&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/djsre03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The autonomous systems team of DJS Racing was formed back in early 2019 to develop a prototype vehicle. Alongside, we have also been developing the software that goes along with it. The team will use the software system presented below for the Formula Student Driverless competition in 2022 (postponed due to the outbreak of COVID-19).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-formula-student-driverless&quot;&gt;About Formula Student Driverless&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formula Student Driverless (FSD) is the world’s largest autonomous racing competition, held annually in Hockenheim, Germany, in which multidisciplinary student teams compete with self-developed driverless racecars every year. In this competition, each team has to race their autonomous car across 5 disciplines - Acceleration, Skidpad, Autocross, and Trackdrive. In the main event, called Trackdrive, a car has to complete 10 laps on an unknown track autonomously as fast as possible against the clock. The track is defined by a set of traffic cones, blue cones on the left and yellow cones on the right-hand side&lt;a href=&quot;#27&quot;&gt;[27]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-layout&quot;&gt;Track Layout&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/track_layout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I shall be describing the overall implementation of a Formula Student Driverless race-car by DJS Racing, India. The race-car can drive autonomously on unknown tracks and switch to Model Predictive Control after track exploration, mapping, and loop-closure detection in the first lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-architecture&quot;&gt;Software Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose the Robot Operating System as our primary framework for software development. In order to run the MPC algorithm at its full potential, the track must be known at least 2s in advance for a speed of 85 kmph. With the current perception setup, it is not possible to achieve accurate mapping of the environment with a 40m (at 85 kmph) of look-ahead. Hence, we need to drive the first lap, exploring the track using a geometric controller such as the Pure Pursuit Controller&lt;a href=&quot;#23&quot;&gt;[23]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#28&quot;&gt;[28]&lt;/a&gt; at a lower speed. After successful mapping and exploration of the track, the car switches to the more performant Model Predictve Control(MPC) for the subsequent laps to race as fast as possible. From this, we can define two modes of our system operation, SLAM mode, and localization mode. To count the number of laps and to detect loop closure, high-level mission planning is done using a finite state machine. This state machine guides to the system to switch between SLAM and localization mode and signals whether the race has finished. Interfacing between the onboard Jetson AGX Xavier and the STM32 is done using the ros-serial package. The STM32 runs FreeRTOS to achieve real-time control of actuators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;system-overview&quot;&gt;System Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/Autonomous System.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;high-level-architecture&quot;&gt;High-level Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/rosgraph.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3d-perception&quot;&gt;3D Perception&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the perception system is to detect traffic cones in the vicinity of the car and determine their color and 3D coordinates in real-time. These cone detections will be then fed as landmarks to the SLAM node to build a map of the track. The perception system takes input from multiple sensors - stereo camera, and a 3D LiDAR. The Basler Ace 2 industrial camera was chosen for our self-developed mono and stereo camera setups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple sources of visual information are chosen so as to increase the redundancy&lt;a href=&quot;#22&quot;&gt;[22]&lt;/a&gt; in the system and to perceive the environment reliably as only one chance is given for the trackdrive race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lidar-3d-object-dectection&quot;&gt;LiDAR 3D Object Dectection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3D Traffic Cone Detection using LiDAR Data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;75%&quot; height=&quot;75%&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/lidar.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point cloud obtained from the LiDAR is first segmented and the ground and out-of-track planes are removed. Afterwards, Euclidean clustering is run on the point cloud to cluster cone patches. The centroid of these cone patches is used to determine the 3D coordinates for each cone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These clusters are also passed through a rule-based outlier filter to remove false cones in the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t estimate the color for each detected cone since the computational costs don’t justify its use for this year and the path planning algorithm works just as well without color information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stereo-3d-object-dectection&quot;&gt;Stereo 3D Object Dectection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure redundancy in the system, an additional camera-based object detection pipeline is added to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have chosen an off-the-shelf object detector, YOLOv3&lt;a href=&quot;#17&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; for object detection for real-time performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stereo Object Detection Pipeline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/stereo_pipeline.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YOLOv3 running on mock cones&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/stereo.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stereo feature matching is then performed using the Semi-Global Block Matching&lt;a href=&quot;#32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt; (SGBM) algorithm to obtain the disparity map and 3D coordinates of the traffic cones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3D point cloud obtained after occlusion reduction in the disparity map&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/stereo_depth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occlusion of background cones is handled by outlier filtering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;velocity-estimation-and-simultaneous-localization-and-mapping&quot;&gt;Velocity Estimation and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extended Kalman Filter was chosen as an estimator for mildly non-linear systems with white Gaussian noise. Our main task here is to fuse data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (SBG Ellipse N), 4 wheel encoders, steering angle sensor, and a dual GPS system in a moving baseline configuration. EKF is also computationally more efficient than the Unscented Kalman Filter&lt;a href=&quot;#20&quot;&gt;[20]&lt;/a&gt; and allows us to estimate the state at 200 Hz. Here, the effects of lateral load transfer are ignored and the track is assumed to be a flat 2D surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Estimation Pipeline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/velocity_estimation.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider that our system model is a constant velocity model (CTRV)&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, the jerk is assumed to be zero in this case and acceleration is used as a pseudo input to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wheel encoders along with the steering angle potentiometer are used to estimate the slip ratios of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 6-DOF state vector is taken as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/state_vector.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p, θ, v&lt;/code&gt; are the position (along x and y), angular velocity, and the linear velocity (along x and y in car frame) of the car respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process model is taken as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/process_model.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is the linear acceleration measured by the IMU and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R(θ)&lt;/code&gt; is the rotation matrix between the sensor frame and the vehicle frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensor model is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/sensor_model.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;θs&lt;/code&gt; is the sensor heading in the body frame and n{.} are additive Gaussian white noises that corrupt the measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different sensors work at different rates and the accuracy also varies between the sensors. Hence, we use multiple update functions for each sensor and we update our beliefs asynchronously&lt;a href=&quot;#26&quot;&gt;[26]&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the acceleration is taken from the IMU, angular velocity from the Gyroscope, and velocities from GPS and wheel encoders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landmark-based FastSLAM&lt;a href=&quot;#8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#15&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; algorithm was chosen for its robustness because of multiple-hypothesis and proposal sampling&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#31&quot;&gt;[31]&lt;/a&gt;. FastSLAM is computationally much more efficient with N.log(N) time complexity as compared to EKF SLAM with a quadratic complexity &lt;a href=&quot;#19&quot;&gt;[19]&lt;/a&gt;. FastSLAM is also much more tunable owing to the fact that it uses a Rao-Backwellized particle filter to express pose estimates. We can simply tune the number of particles to adjust the runtime performance. Data association is done by comparing the mahalanobis distance between an observation and each landmark on the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/slam_pipeline.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our SLAM pipeline runs at 15 Hz to accommodate for the perception pipeline operation rate. The pose estimates from the SLAM node are then integrated by the velocity with time by the velocity estimation node to provide fast pose updates at 200 Hz for the control algorithm. This ensures that the MPC node always receives the latest pose estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;path-planning&quot;&gt;Path Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rrt--delaunay-triangulation-for-waypoints-generation&quot;&gt;RRT + Delaunay Triangulation for Waypoints Generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose the Randomly Exploring Random Trees&lt;a href=&quot;#24&quot;&gt;[24]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#25&quot;&gt;[25]&lt;/a&gt; as our path planning algorithms. Formula Student poses a unique challenge to path planning as there is no definite goal, and we just have to drive straight. Hence, in order to determine the best path, we have proposed a cost function that is assigned to each node. The tree branch with the lowest cost is then chosen as our desired path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;J = Q_delta * delta^2 + Q_theta * theta^2 + Q_cte * cte^2 - Q_cone * cone_count^2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delta: Angular deviation between two nodes. Avoids sharp turns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;theta: Discounted heading. Tree pointing backward to the car are penalized.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cte: Distance between the path and track boundary. Penalizes branches too close to the boundaries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cone_count: Count of cones on both sides of the path. Penalizes shorter paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost is then normalized between 0 and 1 to determine the best path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is not the appropriate approach to path planning in FSD, as we need to have a continous and smooth trajectory in order to ensure that we are driving close to the limits of handling. Hence, we have an additional step of running Delaunay triangulation&lt;a href=&quot;#13&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; on nearby cone positions. The intersection points of the best tree branch and the traingulation segments are then taken as the waypoints for the control algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waypoints that are generated are depicted as blue dots along the track center-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;model-predictive-control&quot;&gt;Model Predictive Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing the first lap using the PID and Pure Pursuit Controller, loop closure is detected and the SLAM algorithm switches to localization mode. This is all handled by the mission planning node. After track exploration and mapping, we switch to Model Predictve Control&lt;a href=&quot;#18&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; as our control method to finish the race as fast as possible at the limits of handling in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the optimization problem is to drive the car along the reference path, following imposed contraints and targeting the desired velocity. The state dynamics is considered as a bicycle model with actuator and drivetrain models along with tire forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dynamic-bicycle-model&quot;&gt;Dynamic Bicycle Model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider the dynamic bicycle model for vehicle dynamics&lt;a href=&quot;#9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#14&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; with non-linear magic tire formula models&lt;a href=&quot;#16&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/dynamic_model.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vehicle-dynamics&quot;&gt;Vehicle Dynamics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/vehicle_dynamics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;X, Y&lt;/em&gt; is the position and is the orientation of the car in the world frame. &lt;em&gt;Vx, Vy&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;ω&lt;/em&gt; are the linear and angular velocities of the car in the body frame respectively. &lt;em&gt;𝛿&lt;/em&gt; is the steering angle, &lt;em&gt;Lf&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lr&lt;/em&gt; are the length from the front and rear axles to the center-of-gravity respectively and &lt;em&gt;Iz&lt;/em&gt; is the inertia moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tire-model&quot;&gt;Tire Model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/tire_model.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/tire_model_x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;em&gt;D, C, B&lt;/em&gt; are coefficients obtained from the Pacejka tire model. &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; is the driving command (acceleration), &lt;em&gt;Cr&lt;/em&gt; is the rolling resistance, &lt;em&gt;α{f, r}&lt;/em&gt; are tire slip angles, and &lt;em&gt;Cd&lt;/em&gt; is the drag coefficient. &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; is the mass of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-input&quot;&gt;State Input&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/state_input.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-lateral-and-cross-track-errors-are-defined-as&quot;&gt;The lateral and cross-track errors are defined as&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cte` = cte - v * sin(epsi) * dt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;epsi` = epsi + v / Lf * (-delta) * dt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;and-hence-the-cost-function-is-defined-as&quot;&gt;And hence, the cost function is defined as&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;J = Q_cte * cte^2 + Q_epsi * epsi^2 + Q_v * (v - vmax)^2 + Q_delta * delta^2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+ Q_a * a^2 + F * (a` - a)^2 + Q_ddelta * (delta` - delta)^2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this optimization problem is to drive the vehicle as close as possible to the track center line, with heading along the track direction. Rapid changes in the state inputs, as well as linear and angular velocities, are penalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/videos/mpc.gif&quot; alt=&quot;this slowpoke moves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimization problem is then solved directly using the IPOPT non-linear optimization library&lt;a href=&quot;#6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; in a receding horizon fashion for over 15 steps for a horizon of 1.5 secs. There is an approximately 100 ms delay between computed command and actuation, hence we choose an actuator vector in the future (about 100 ms in the future) to compensate for mechanical delays.&lt;br /&gt;
However, an improvement is required here as IPOPT is not designed for real-time systems and considerably slows down with an increase in sequence size&lt;a href=&quot;#30&quot;&gt;[30]&lt;/a&gt;. Hence, we need to use a convex optimization library such as HPIPM&lt;a href=&quot;#29&quot;&gt;[29]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FSSIM &lt;a href=&quot;#4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; simulation framework by AMZ Driverless has been used for the codebase. The FSSIM simulator uses a Gazebo plugin that uses a basic vehicle model which is discretized with Euler Forward discretization to achieve 99% of real-world performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ros-bags-from-github-pull-requests-and-actual-car-races-can-be-visualized-in-the-app&quot;&gt;ROS Bags from GitHub Pull Requests and actual car races can be visualized in the app&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/image3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simulation framework, on every pull request, runs the codebase and important ROS topics are recorded into ROS Bags and uploaded to the server. Each ROS Bag is played on the remote server and the run is recorded using VirtualGL, the videos are then stored in a NoSQL database for backup and querying. The client app can establish a remote database connection to visualize the ROS Bags. The server automatically replays the bag file and stores the recorded videos. To ensure software reliability, each pull request is first compiled using GitHub Actions and run on our CI server hosted on AWS. Only after all checks have passed and the simulation runs without any issues, a pull request can be merged.&lt;/p&gt;

The company has also recently expanded into providing physical robots with applications such as grocery delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mowito being a startup, provided me a lot of avenues to learn new things. The work ranged from robot navigation, lidar stitching to cloud computing. Often the work involved projects that either the team or nobody in the entire world has experience working. This helped me quickly adapt to situations and learn new things in a short time, often required for an early-stage startup. I had great mentors who bestowed me with the responsibility to directly work on their navigation stack - their core offering that is used in warehouse environments by companies around the world. The stack was being directly deployed on ROS-based robots that were being remotely monitored by us. Under the mentor’s guidance, I was able to learn agile project management, startup accelerators, how to manage people in a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short video showing some of the deployments using Mowito’s navigation stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X_pU2qYaPRc&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I will be presenting the work done by me during the internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-feet-detection&quot;&gt;Human feet detection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ported the ROS leg-detector package to support ROS 2 while making it more reliable and accurate. The package was required by one of our clients to detect workers in their warehouses. The load-carrying robot changes its global trajectory if it encounters a dynamic obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;75%&quot; height=&quot;75%&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/mw_leg_detector.png&quot; alt=&quot;Leg Detector Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the above demo, we used an RPLIDAR, with a resolution of 0.33 degrees at 10 Hz. The lidar map was converted to an image array to detect human foot clusters. After data association with existing foot position priors, the extended Kalman filter was updated from the measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way, the ROS Discourse post was featured in ROS News for the Week of January 10th, 2021 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros-news-for-the-week-of-january-10th-2021/18488&quot;&gt;https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros-news-for-the-week-of-january-10th-2021/18488&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motion-primitives-generation&quot;&gt;Motion Primitives Generation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maxl controller developed by Mowito uses motion primitives to generate local paths for navigation. The motion primitives are computed using the robot dimensions, path fan angle, expand distance, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a GIF showing possible paths for a robot using motion primitives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/mw_maxl_demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;MAXL Demo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primitives are generated using a nearest-neighbor query approach using the SciPy’s KDTree module to achieve linear-logarithmic time complexity. The KD tree is used to find the nearest data points in n-dimensional NumPy arrays. Further, using basic trigonometry, the paths are generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link to the tool - &lt;a href=&quot;http://ec2-15-207-68-243.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com/&quot;&gt;http://ec2-15-207-68-243.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the primitives look like:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/mw_mprim_plot.png&quot; alt=&quot;assets/images/mw_mprim_plot.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improvements-to-maxl-controller&quot;&gt;Improvements to MaxL controller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/mw_maxl_rosbot.png&quot; alt=&quot;assets/images/mw_maxl_rosbot.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also worked on the core MaxL navigation stack and the controller. My initial work was related to improving the function stubs to get myself more familiar with the codebase. After that my contributions were to reduce the number of oscillations in the planned path, architecture improvements, automated testing, and benchmarking. The controller previously had some code duplication between ROS 1 and 2, I decoupled the core library (the pure pursuit controller and some other stuff) and made it into a single CMake package which is now used by the ROS 1 and 2 packages as a CMake subdirectory. This greatly saved development time, and a developer needed to only make changes to one repository to improve both ROS 1 and 2 implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other improvements included grouping similar function parameters into a single struct to reduce the number of parameters being passed into the functions. Some functions previously had as many as 60 parameters for path planning. Consequently, they hover around 12 now (Structs hold the individual values).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sensor-calibration-and-fusion&quot;&gt;Sensor calibration and fusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to also work on the client-facing services at Mowito. Some packages developed by me served to calibrate wheel encoders for differential drive robots and fusing point clouds from multiple lidars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LiDAR fusion:&lt;/b&gt;
A ROS 2 package for fusing data provided by multiple lidars placed on a robot.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;GitHub repository: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mowito/mw_lidar_fusion&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mowito/mw_lidar_fusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The point clouds are fused using the TF transform between two link frames, and matching ROS messages by the time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a demo showing two fused point clouds with white points depicting data points that fall within a certain angle after filtering:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/mw_lidar_fusion.png&quot; alt=&quot;assets/images/mw_lidar_fusion.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wheel encoder calibration:&lt;/b&gt;
Our deployments often needed periodic manual maintenance to function well. One recurring problem was a deviation in the pose estimated using wheel odometry. Due to wheel slip and other factors, a bias was introduced in the system that led to the robot going way off track from its goal position. This was a critical issue since these robots were handling fragile pieces of equipment in the warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;GitHub repository: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mowito/odometry_calibration&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mowito/odometry_calibration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here are the plots for reference count per second vs wheel encoder feedback value for both left and right wheels:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/mw_calib_left.png&quot; alt=&quot;assets/images/mw_calib_left.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/mw_calib_right.png&quot; alt=&quot;assets/images/mw_calib_right.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The wheel encoders didn’t perform well whenever a sudden change in motion was observed. A correction factor is thus introduced while calculating the robot angular velocity or the yaw rate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Odometry plot after yaw correction:

  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maxl-vs-nav2-dwb&quot;&gt;MaxL vs Nav2 DWB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have read so far, then you might probably wonder - why use a proprietary controller instead of an already widely used one such as DWA/DWB offered by ROS Navigation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the answer is that in some cases you might want to leverage the reduced computational cost of running the MaxL controller - it runs without using a cost map! Another benefit is that in most cases, MaxL provides more smooth paths and fewer recoveries during the robot’s operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a comparison between MaxL and ROS Nav2’s DWB over their execution times:
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/mw_maxl_vs_dwb.png&quot; alt=&quot;assets/images/mw_maxl_vs_dwb.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, MaxL is faster than the DWB controller albeit with a higher variance. It is also important to notice that the DWB controller gets much slower as the cost map resolution increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the internship, I created an automated testing tool to benchmark the two controllers. The CGAL library was used to spawn random objects with a predefined area limit, to stress the two controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/mw_maxl_ats.png&quot; alt=&quot;assets/images/mw_maxl_ats.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image above is a screenshot of an RViz window depicting a 5 x 5 room with 40% of its area being occupied. The lidar points are generated circularly with a ray being cast onto the object at each iteration. The intersection point is then computed using CGAL and added to the lidar point cloud array. The demo tries to replicate an RPLiDAR with a 0.33 degrees resolution operating at 10 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
