  abstract     = "We propose a computationally efficient transfer learning method to conduct opinion mining on Hindi language using a mixed dataset containing tweets and movie reviews in Hindi. For this purpose, we generate a complete Hindi corpus of our own consisting of around 18,639 Hindi articles from the Wikimedia dumps database for training the language models and a labeled dataset consisting of a mixture of 10,000 tweets and movie reviews in the Hindi language. Our method achieves significantly better accuracy than the currently existing approaches that involve large language models like mBERT, hindiBERT, Hindi-TPU-Electra, etc."

We also curate our own dataset for the problem. Along with this, we introduce a benchmark for the task of Federated Learning based emoji prediction in the Hindi language. It is observed how introducing Federated Learning doesn't significantly impact the accuracy and thus, the privacy-accuracy tradeoff is also preserved for the same.",

  abstract     = "Deep Learning, a branch of Machine Learning is a rapidly expanding field in the Industry 4.0 revolution. The number of applications of Deep Learning are enormous - finding multiple uses in a single domain. Deep Learning enhances current research and provides better perception to a wide spectrum of domains, including Music Information Retrieval. Music is an art, that is widely celebrated worldwide, with countless songs being released or published every day. Music can be classified into many 'genres'. A statistical study conducted in 2018 shows that there are more than 10 genres of music, with `Hip-Hop/Rap 'being the most with most music composed. When one decides to listen to music, one usually has a particular genre in mind, and expects the music application he or she is using to provide numerous songs falling in that genre. A good music application would not only provide many songs, but also increase the ease of access to a particular song or genre. Due to tremendous increase in the amount of digital data available on the internet, the task of accurately classifying music files has become a major problem for music applications like YouTube Music, iTunes or Spotify, which can be solved with the help of Deep Learning techniques. This paper includes an indepth comparison of four transfer learning architectures, i.e. Resnet34, Resnet50, VGG16 and AlexNet, which were the best performing models during different times in ImageNet, to accomplish the task of classification of different songs on the basis of their genre."
