							<p>At DJS Racing, the Formula Student Team of Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, we are building one of the first driverless Formula Student race-car of India.</p>
							<h2>About Formula Student Driverless</h2>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p> Formula
								Student Driverless(FSD) is the world's largest autonomous racing competition, held annualy in Hockenheim, Germany, in which multidisciplinary student teams compete
								with a self-developed driverless racecars every year. 
								In this competition, each team has to race their autonomous car across 5 disciplines - Acceleration, Skidpad, Autocross, and Trackdrive. 
								In the main event, called Trackdrive, a car has to complete 10 laps on an unknown track autonomously as fast as possible against the clock. 
								The track is defined by a set of traffic cones, blue cones on the left and yellow cones on the right hand side.</p>
								<h4 align="center">Track Layout</h4>
								<p align="center">
									<img width="75%" height="75%" src="images/track_layout.jpg">
								</p>
								<p>In this blog, I am going to introduce to you the overall implementation of a Formula Student Driverless race-car by DJS Racing, India. The race-car can drive autonomously on unknown tracks and switch to Model Predictive Control after track exploration, mapping and loop-closure detection in the first lap.</p>
							<h2>Software Architecture</h2>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p> We chose the Robot Operating System as our primary framework for software development. In order to run the MPC algorithm at its full potential, the track must be known at least 2s in advanced for a speed of 85 kmph. With the current perception setup, it is not possible to achieve accurate mapping of environment with a 40m (at 85 kmph) of look-ahead. Hence, we need to drive the first lap, exploring the track using a geometric controller such as the Pure Pursuit Controller at a lower speed. After successful mapping and exploration of the track, the car switches to the more performant Model Predicitve Control(MPC) for the subsequent laps to race as fast as possible. From this we can define two modes of our system operation, SLAM mode and localization mode. To count the number of laps and to detect loop closure, high level mission planning is done using a finite state machine. This state machine guides to system to switch between SLAM and localization mode and signals whether the race has finished. Interfacing between the onboard Jetson AGX Xavier and the STM32 is done using the ros-serial package. The STM32 runs FreeRTOS to achieve real-time control of actuators.</p>

							</p>
							<h2>3D Perception</h2>
							<p>The goal of the perception system is to detection traffic cones in the vincinity of the car and determine their color and 3D coordinates in real-time. These cone detections will be then fed as landmarks to the SLAM node to build a map of the track. The perception system taken input from multiple sensors - a mono camera, stereo camera and a 3D LiDAR. The Basler Ace 2 industrial camera was chosen for our self-developed mono and stereo camera setups. </p>
							<!-- The Ouster OS1-32 LiDAR was chosen as our main LiDAR. -->
							<p>Multiple sources of visual information are chosen so as to increase the redundancy in the system and to perceive the environment reliably as only one chance is given for the trackdrive race.</p>

							<h4>LiDAR 3D Object Dectection</h4>

							</p>
							<p>The point cloud obtained from the LiDAR is first segmented and the ground and out-of-track planes are removed. Afterward Euclidean clustering is run on the point cloud to cluster cone patches. The centroid of these cone patches are used to determine the 3D coordinates for each cone. They are futher projected on to a 2D plane from the LiDAR frame so as to obtain a 32x32 image. A state-of-the-art CNN is then run on these image patches to estimate the color for each cone.</p>
							<p>These cluster are also passed through a rule-based outlier filter to remove false cones in the map.</p>

							</p>
							<h4>Stereo 3D Object Dectection</h4>
							<p>In order to ensure redundancy in the system, an additional camera-based object detection pipeline is added to the system.</p>
							<p>We have chosen an off-the-shelf object detector, YOLOv3 for object detection for real-time performance.</p>

								Stereo feature matching is then performed using the Semi-Global Block Matching (SGBM) algorithm to obtain the disparity map and 3D coordinates of the traffic cones.

							<h4>Monocular 3D Object Detection</h4>
							<p>Monocular 3D Object Detection is performed using the Perspective 7-Point transformation with the PnP RANSAC algorithm. This is considering the fact that we know the exact physical dimensions of each cone. The keypoints are then used to transform 2D image coordinates to 3D world coordinates.
								Keypoints for each cone image patch are obtained using the RektNet CNN architecture by MIT Driverless (Accurate, Low-Latency Visual Perception for Autonomous Racing:Challenges, Mechanisms, and Practical Solutions. Kieran Strobel et al., 2020).

							<h2>
								Velocity Estimation and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
							</h2>
							<p>The extended Kalman Filter was chosen as an estimator for mildly non-linear systems with white Gaussian noise. Our main task here is to fuse data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (SBG Ellipse N), 4 wheel encoders, steering angle sensor and a dual GPS system in a moving baseline configuration. EKF is also computationally more efficient than the Unscented Kalman Filter and allows us to estimate the state at 200 Hz.</p>
							<p align="center">
								Velocity Estimation Pipeline
							</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img width="75%" height="75%" src="images/velocity_estimation.png">
							</p>
							<p>We assume that our system model is a Contant Turn Rate and Acceleration model (CTRA), the jerk is assumed to be zero in this case and acceleration is used as an input to the system.</p>
							<p>The wheel encoders along with the steering angle potentiometer are used to estimate the slip ratios of the vehicle.</p>
							<p>The state vector is taken as</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img width="45%" height="45%" src="images/state_vector.jpg">
							</p>
							<p>Where <code>p, θ, v</code> are the position (along x and y), angular velocity and the linear velocity (along x and y in car frame) of the car respectively.</p>
							<p>The process model is taken as</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img width="45%" height="45%" src="images/process_model.jpg">
							</p>
							<p>Where <code>a</code> is the linear acceleration measured by the IMU and <code>R(θ)</code> is the rotation matrix between the sensor frame and the vehicle frame.</p>
							<p>The sensor model is</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img width="45%" height="45%" src="images/sensor_model.jpg">
							</p>
							<p>Where <code>θs</code> is the sensor heading in body frame and n{.} are additive Gaussian white noises that corrupt the measurements.</p>
							<p>Different sensors work at different rates and the accuracy also varies between the sensors. Hence, we use multiple update functions for each sensor and we update our beliefs asynchronously. Here, the acceleration is taken from the IMU, angular velocity from the Gyroscope, and velocities from GPS and wheel encoders. Sensor drift and failure is detected with the help of Chi-Squared test.</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img src="https://www.gstatic.com/education/formulas2/-1/en/chi_squared_test.svg" />
							</p>
							<p>If the value of Chi falls below a certain threshold, the measurement is ignored.</p>
							<p>Design of an Autonomous Racecar: Perception, State Estimation and
								System Integration (Valls et al., 2018)
							</p>
							<p>
								The landmark-based FastSLAM algorithm was chosen for its robustness because of multiple-hypothesis and proposal sampling.
								FastSLAM is computationally much more efficient with N.log(N) time complexity as compared to EKF SLAM with a quadratic complexity.
								FastSLAM is also much more tunable owing to the fact that it uses Rao-Backwellized particle filter to express pose estimates. We can simply tune the number of particles to adjust the runtime performance.
								Data association is done by comparing the mahalanobis distance between an observation and each landmark on the map.
							</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img width="75%" height="75%" src="images/slam_pipeline.jpg" />
							</p>		
							<p>
								Our SLAM pipeline runs at 15 Hz to accomodate for the perception pipeline operation rate. The pose estimates from the SLAM node are then taken by the velocity estimation node to provide fast pose updates at 200 Hz for the control algorithm. This ensures that the MPC node always recieves the latest pose estimates. 
							</p>						
							<h2>
								Path Planning
							</h2>
							<p>
								<h4 align="center">
									RRT + Delaunay Triangulation for Waypoints Generation
								</h4>
							</p>
							<p>We chose the Randomly Exploring Random Trees(LaValle et al., 1998) as our path planning algorithms. Formula Student poses a unique challenge to path planning as there is no definite goal, and we just have to drive straight. Hence, in order to determine the best path, we have proposed a cost function that is assigned to each node. The tree branch with the lowest cost is then chosen as our desired path.</p>
							<code>
								J = Q_delta * delta^2 + Q_theta * theta^2 + Q_cte * cte^2 - Q_cone * cone_count^2
							</code>
							<br>
							Where,
							<ul>
								<li>delta: Angular deviation between two nodes. Avoids sharp turns.</li>
								<li>theta: Discounted heading. Tree pointing backwards to the car are penalized.</li>
								<li>cte: Distance between the path and track boundary. Penalizes branches too close to the boundaries.</li>
								<li>cone_count: Count of cones on both sides of the path. Penalizes shorter paths.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The cost is then normalized between 0 and 1 to determine the best path.</p>
							<p>However, this is not the appropriate approach to path planning in FSD, as we need to have a continous and smooth trajectory in order to ensure that we are driving close to the limits of handling. Hence, we have an additional step of running Delaunay traingulation on nearby cone positions. The intersection points of the best tree branch and the traingulation segments are then takes as the waypoints for the control algorithm.</p>

							</p>
							<p>The waypoints that are generated are depicted as blue dots along the track center-line.</p>
							<h2>Model Predictive Control</h2>
							<p>After finishing the first lap using the PID and Pure Pursuit Controller, loop closure is detected and the SLAM algorithm switches to localization mode. This is all handled by the mission planning node. After track exploration and mapping, we switch to Model Predicitve Control as our control method to finish the race as fast as possible at the limits of handling in real-time.</p>
							<p>The goal of the optimization problem is to drive the car along the reference path, following imposed contraints and targeting desired velocity. The state dynamics follows a bicycle model with actuator and drivetrain models along with tire forces.</p>
							<p>
								<h4 align="center">Dynamic Bicycle Model</h4>
							</p>
							<p align="center">We consider the dynamic bicycle model for vehicle dynamics with non-linear magic tire formula models</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img width="50%" height="50%" src="images/dynamic_model.jpg">

								<h4 align="center">Vehicle Dynamics</h4>
							</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img width="50%" height="50%" src="images/vehicle_dynamics.jpg">
							</p>
							<p>Where <i>X, Y</i> is the position and <i></i> is the orientation of the car in the world frame. <i>V<sub>x</sub>, V<sub>y</sub></i> and <i>ω</i> are the linear and angular velocities of the car in the body fram respectively. <i>𝛿</i> is the steering angle, <i>L<sub>f</sub></i> and <i>L<sub>r</sub></i> are the length from the front and rear axles to the center-of-gravity respectively and <i>I<sub>z</sub></i> is the inertia moment.</i></p>
							<p>
								<h4 align="center">Tire Model</h4>
							</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img width="50%" height="50%" src="images/tire_model.jpg">
							</p>
							<p>Here <i>D, C, B</i> are coefficients obtained from the Pacejka tire model. <i>d</i> is the driving command (acceleration), <i>C<sub>r</sub></i> is the rolling resistance, <i>α<sub>f, r</sub></i> are tire slip angles, and <i>C<sub>d</sub></i> is the drag coefficient. <i>C<sub>m1, m2</sub></i> are experimentally determined constants to calculate the driving force.</p>
							<p>
								<h4 align="center">State Input</h4>
							</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img width="50%" height="50%" src="images/state_input.jpg">
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>The lateral and cross-track errors are defined as</h4>
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>
									cte` = cte - v * sin(epsi) * dt
								</code>
								<br>
								<code>
									epsi` = epsi +  v / Lf * (-delta) * dt
								</code>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>And hence, the cost function is defined as</h4>
								<code>
									J = Q_cte * cte^2 + Q_epsi * epsi^2 + Q_v * (v - vmax)^2 + Q_delta * delta^2
								</code>
								<br>
								<code>
									+ Q_a * a^2 + F * (a` - a)^2 +  Q_ddelta * (delta` - delta)^2
								</code>
							</p>
							<p>The objective of this optimization problem is to drive the vehicle as close as possible to the track center line, with heading along the track direction. Rapid changes in the state inputs as well as linear and angular velocities are penalized.</p>
							<p align="center">
								<img src="videos\mpc.gif" width="75%" height="75%" alt="this slowpoke moves"/>
							</p>
							<p>
								The optimization is problem is then solved directly using the IPOPT non-linear optimization library in a receding horizon fashion for over 15 steps for a horizon of 1.5 secs. There is an approximately 100 ms delay between computed command and actuation, hence we choose an actuator vector in the future (about 100 ms in the future) to compensate for mechanical delays.
								<br>
							    However, an improvement is required here as IPOPT is not designed for real-time systems and considerably slows down with an increase in sequence size. Hence, we need to use a convex optimization library such as HPIPM.

							<p>The FSSIM simulation framework by AMZ Driverless has been used for the codebase. The FSSIM simulator employs a Gazebo plugin that uses a basic vehicle model which is discretized with Euler Forward discretization to achieve 99% of real world performance.The simulation framework, on every pull request, runs the codebase and important ROS topics are recorded into ROS Bags and uploaded to the server. Each ROS Bag is played on the remote server and the run is recorded using VirtualGL, the videos are then stored in a NoSQL database for backup and querying. The client app can establish remote database connection to visualize the ROS Bags. The server automatically replays the bag file and stores the recorded videos.To ensure software reliability, each pull request is first compiled using GitHub Actions and run on our CI server hosted on AWS. Only after all checks have passed and the simulation runs without any issues, a pull request can be merged.</p>
